# py2dFDTD
Two dimensional finite differences time domain (FDTD) simulation, based on Taflove's book [1] written in python.
The code calculates electromagnetic fields for a scattering setup in the time domain and visualizes the results.

Example: dielectric cylinder with constant refractive index (n=1.25), excited by a plane wave
